# TCBench_0.1

Github repository gathering the scripts used for Master's thesis. The goal is to post-process AI weather models' outputs (currently [GraphCast](10.1126/science.adi2336) and [PanguWeather](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06185-3)) to improve the tropical cyclone intensity, as reported in IBTrACS.  
The code is still in development. If you'd like to use it, use the dev branch, as the main branch does not contain updated code.
