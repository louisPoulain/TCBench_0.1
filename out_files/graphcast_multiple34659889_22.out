2023-10-25 22:49:41,313 INFO Model description: 
GraphCast model at 0.25deg resolution, with 13 pressure levels. This model is
trained on ERA5 data from 1979 to 2017, and fine-tuned on HRES-fc0 data from
2016 to 2021 and can be causally evaluated on 2022 and later years. This model
does not take `total_precipitation_6hr` as inputs and can make predictions in an
operational setting (i.e., initialised from HRES-fc0).

2023-10-25 22:51:45.231482: E external/xla/xla/service/slow_operation_alarm.cc:65] Constant folding an instruction is taking > 1s:

This isn't necessarily a bug; constant-folding is inherently a trade-off between compilation time and speed at runtime. XLA has some guards that attempt to keep constant folding from taking too long, but fundamentally you'll always be able to come up with an input program that takes a long time.

If you'd like to file a bug, run with envvar XLA_FLAGS=--xla_dump_to=/tmp/foo and attach the results.
